# Binary Search Trees and Hash Tables Lab 18. 
Authors: Collin Meredith, Ryan Groesch

## Feature Tasks of Lab
    Add a remove(value) method to the BinarySearchTree class presented in class.

    Implement a K-ary-Tree Class
        implement the following prototype methods
            find(value) should iterate over all child nodes using a breath-first traversal and return the first node that has that value, it should return null if a node with the value is not found
            toString(str) should iterate over all child nodes using a breath-first traversal and concatenate their values separated by newlines in to a string
            toArray(array) should use a depth-first traversal and push all the tree's elements into an array.

## Big O considerations:
